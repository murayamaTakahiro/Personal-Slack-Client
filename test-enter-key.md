# Enter Key Fix Testing Guide

## Problem
The Enter key in the PostDialog's message input field was triggering search re-execution instead of creating a line break.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **App.svelte Global Handler (Capture Phase)**
- Added comprehensive Enter key detection in the global keydown handler
- When PostDialog is open and Enter is pressed in a TEXTAREA:
  - Stops propagation immediately
  - Prevents the event from bubbling to SearchBar

### 2. **SearchBar.svelte Handlers**
- Modified all Enter key handlers to check if PostDialog is open:
  - `handleKeydown()` - main search input
  - `handleDateKeydown()` - date input fields
  - `handleUrlKeydown()` - URL input field
- If PostDialog is open, Enter key events are ignored

### 3. **MentionTextarea.svelte**
- Already had Enter key handling with stopPropagation
- Added stopImmediatePropagation for extra safety
- Added comprehensive debug logging

### 4. **PostDialog.svelte**
- Dialog-level keydown handler also stops Enter propagation
- Added stopImmediatePropagation for TEXTAREA Enter events

## Implementation Details
The fix is implemented across multiple components without debug logging in production:

## Testing Steps

1. **Open PostDialog**
   - Press `P` to open post dialog
   - Or press `T` while a message is selected

2. **Test Enter Key**
   - Type some text in the message field
   - Press Enter (should create a new line)
   - Verify in console logs that:
     - Enter key is captured and blocked at App level
     - SearchBar ignores the Enter key
     - No search is triggered

3. **Test Ctrl+Enter**
   - Type a message
   - Press Ctrl+Enter (should send the message)

4. **Test with SearchBar**
   - Close PostDialog
   - Click in search input
   - Press Enter (should trigger search)

## Expected Behavior

When pressing Enter in PostDialog textarea:
- The Enter key creates a new line in the textarea
- No search is triggered in the SearchBar
- The event is properly stopped at multiple levels to ensure robust handling

## Verification
- Enter creates line breaks in PostDialog message field ✓
- Enter does NOT trigger search when PostDialog is open ✓
- Ctrl+Enter still sends the message ✓
- Enter still works for search when PostDialog is closed ✓
