# Phase 3: Multiple DM Search - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Phase 3 of the DM search implementation has been successfully completed. The system now supports searching across multiple DM and Group DM channels simultaneously with parallel execution and proper rate limiting.

## Implementation Date
- **Completed**: 2025-01-24

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Enhancements
- **Multi-DM Support in `search_messages`**: Extended to detect and handle multiple DM channel IDs (D* and G* prefixes)
- **Parallel Search Execution**: All selected DM channels are searched in parallel using async/await
- **DM-Specific Search Path**: DM channels use `conversations.history` API instead of `search.messages`
- **Rate Limiting**: Added semaphore-based rate limiting to prevent API throttling
- **Result Aggregation**: Results from all channels are combined and sorted chronologically

### 2. Rate Limiting Protection
- **Semaphore Implementation**: Uses `tokio::sync::Semaphore` with MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=30
- **Per-Request Delay**: Small delay (RATE_LIMIT_DELAY_MS=20ms) to prevent burst issues
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Failed searches in individual channels don't stop the entire multi-search

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel Execution**: All DM searches run concurrently, not sequentially
- **Shared Client**: Uses Arc<SlackClient> to share the client across async tasks
- **Efficient Aggregation**: Results are collected and sorted only once after all searches complete
- **Caching**: Search results are cached using channel IDs as part of the cache key

### 4. Frontend Integration
- **ChannelSelector Support**: Already supports multi-selection mode (Ctrl+M)
- **DM Channel Handling**: Properly uses channel IDs for DM/Group DM channels
- **Comma-Separated Format**: Selected channels are passed as "D123,D456,G789"
- **Loading State**: Shows loading indicator during multi-channel search

## Technical Details

### Search Flow for Multi-DM
1. User selects multiple DM channels in multi-select mode
2. Frontend sends comma-separated channel IDs to backend
3. Backend detects multi-channel search (contains comma)
4. Channels are split and filtered (DM vs regular channels)
5. For each DM channel, a parallel search task is created:
   - Acquires rate limit permit
   - Calls `search_dm_messages` with the channel ID
   - Applies date filters if specified
   - Returns results or empty vector on error
6. All parallel tasks are awaited using `join_all`
7. Results are aggregated and sorted by timestamp
8. Final results are returned to frontend

### Code Changes
- **src-tauri/src/commands/search.rs**:
  - Modified `search_messages` to handle multi-DM searches
  - Modified `search_messages_fast` for optimized multi-DM searches
  - Added DM channel detection logic
  - Implemented parallel search with proper error handling

- **src-tauri/src/slack/client.rs**:
  - Enhanced `search_dm_messages` with semaphore-based rate limiting
  - Improved error messages for DM-specific issues

### API Usage
- **Regular Channels**: `search.messages` API
- **DM/Group DM Channels**: `conversations.history` API
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 30 concurrent requests
- **Result Limit**: 100 messages per channel (configurable)

## Performance Characteristics
- **Target**: <5 seconds for 10+ DMs
- **Actual**: Depends on network and API response time
- **Concurrency**: Up to 30 parallel searches
- **Memory**: Efficient - results are streamed and aggregated
- **Caching**: Subsequent searches are instant if cached

## Testing
- Created test script: `test-multi-dm-search.sh`
- Verified parallel execution
- Confirmed rate limiting works
- Tested with mixed channel types (DM + Group DM)

## Usage Instructions
1. Enable DM channels in the application settings
2. In the channel selector, press Ctrl+M to enable multi-select mode
3. Select multiple DM/Group DM channels
4. Click "Apply Selection" or press Ctrl+Shift+A
5. Enter search query and execute search
6. Results from all selected DMs will be shown, sorted by time

## Known Limitations
- Progress updates show overall loading, not per-channel progress (due to parallel execution)
- Maximum of 100 messages per channel per search (configurable)
- Requires appropriate Slack token permissions (im:read, mpim:read, im:history)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Progressive loading with per-channel progress indicators
- Streaming results as each channel completes
- Configurable concurrency limits per workspace
- Smart caching with partial invalidation
