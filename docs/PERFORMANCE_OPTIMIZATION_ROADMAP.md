# Performance Optimization Roadmap

## 📋 Document Purpose
This document tracks the performance optimization efforts for the Personal Slack Client, initiated on 2025-01-05 following the analysis in `LIVE_MODE_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md`. It serves as a living roadmap to ensure all planned optimizations are implemented systematically and their impact is measured.

## 🎯 Completion Criteria
This optimization project will be considered complete when:
1. All Phase 1 (Quick Wins) optimizations are implemented
2. Performance metrics show at least 50% improvement in initial load time
3. Memory usage is reduced by at least 40% for 1000+ messages
4. User-perceived performance matches or exceeds the official Slack client
5. All optimizations are documented with before/after metrics

## 🔍 Monitoring and Validation

### Performance Monitoring Tools:
```typescript
// Already implemented in performanceMonitor.ts
import { PerformanceMonitor } from './lib/services/performanceMonitor';

const monitor = new PerformanceMonitor();
monitor.measure('search', async () => {
  await searchMessages(query);
});
monitor.report(); // Shows all metrics
```

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1. **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Target <2s
2. **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Target <1s
3. **Memory Footprint**: Target <100MB for 1000 messages
4. **CPU Usage**: Target <10% idle
5. **Network Efficiency**: Target 50% reduction in API calls
