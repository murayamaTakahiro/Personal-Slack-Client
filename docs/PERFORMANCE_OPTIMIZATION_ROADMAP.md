# Performance Optimization Roadmap

## 📋 Document Purpose
This document tracks the performance optimization efforts for the Personal Slack Client, initiated on 2025-01-05 following the analysis in `LIVE_MODE_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md`. It serves as a living roadmap to ensure all planned optimizations are implemented systematically and their impact is measured.

## 🎯 Completion Criteria
This optimization project will be considered complete when:
1. All Phase 1 (Quick Wins) optimizations are implemented
2. Performance metrics show at least 50% improvement in initial load time
3. Memory usage is reduced by at least 40% for 1000+ messages
4. User-perceived performance matches or exceeds the official Slack client
5. All optimizations are documented with before/after metrics

## 📊 Current Status (2025-01-05)

### ✅ Completed Optimizations

#### 1. Virtual Scrolling → Progressive Loading (Completed)
- **Decision**: Abandoned Virtual Scrolling due to complexity and bugs
- **Implementation**: Progressive Loading with IntersectionObserver
- **Result**: 
  - Code reduced by 1000+ lines
  - All features working (reactions, keyboard shortcuts)
  - Seamless UX without manual "Load More" buttons
- **Commit**: c07271d

### 🔄 Remaining Optimizations

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days remaining)

### 2. React Component Memoization ⏳
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours  
**Expected Impact**: 40-60% reduction in re-renders

#### Implementation Plan:
```typescript
// MessageItem.svelte - Add memoization
export default React.memo(MessageItem, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  return prevProps.message.ts === nextProps.message.ts &&
         prevProps.message.text === nextProps.message.text &&
         prevProps.message.reactions === nextProps.message.reactions;
});
```

#### Success Metrics:
- [ ] React DevTools Profiler shows <100ms render time for 100 messages
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders when scrolling
- [ ] Reaction updates only re-render affected message

### 3. API Request Batching ⏳
**Status**: Partially Implemented (apiBatcher.ts exists but not used)  
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours  
**Expected Impact**: 70% reduction in API calls

#### Implementation Plan:
1. Complete `apiBatcher.ts` implementation
2. Integrate with search functionality
3. Batch multi-channel searches into single request
4. Implement request deduplication

#### Success Metrics:
- [ ] Multi-channel search uses single batched API call
- [ ] Duplicate requests within 100ms window are merged
- [ ] Network tab shows 70% fewer requests

### 4. Lazy Loading Reactions ⏳
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours  
**Expected Impact**: 30% faster initial render

#### Implementation Plan:
```typescript
// Defer reaction loading until message is in viewport
const loadReactions = async (messageTs: string) => {
  if (!reactionsLoaded.has(messageTs)) {
    const reactions = await fetchReactions(messageTs);
    updateMessageReactions(messageTs, reactions);
  }
};
```

#### Success Metrics:
- [ ] Initial message render <50ms without reactions
- [ ] Reactions load within 200ms of message becoming visible
- [ ] No layout shift when reactions load

## Phase 2: Core Improvements (3-5 days)

### 5. Smart Caching System 📋
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Time**: 8 hours  
**Expected Impact**: 50% reduction in redundant API calls

#### Implementation Components:
- Memory cache (LRU, 500 messages max)
- IndexedDB for persistent storage
- Cache invalidation strategy
- Offline support

### 6. Web Worker for Heavy Operations 📋
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Time**: 6 hours  
**Expected Impact**: Main thread blocking reduced by 80%

#### Operations to Offload:
- Markdown parsing
- Message formatting
- Search result processing
- Emoji replacement

### 7. Incremental Search Results 📋
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Time**: 10 hours  
**Expected Impact**: 60% faster search updates

#### Features:
- Only fetch new messages since last search
- Server-side deduplication
- Differential updates to UI

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (1-2 weeks)

### 8. WebSocket Real-time Updates 🔮
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Time**: 20 hours  
**Expected Impact**: Real-time message updates, 80% reduction in polling

### 9. Predictive Prefetching 🔮
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Time**: 12 hours  
**Expected Impact**: Instant perceived loading for predicted actions

### 10. Service Worker Optimization 🔮
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimated Time**: 15 hours  
**Expected Impact**: Offline capability, background sync
