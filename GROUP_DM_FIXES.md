# Group DM Implementation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Display Name Resolution
**Problem**: User "murayama" was showing as "yandt89" in Group DM names
**Solution**:
- Enhanced the user name resolution logic to better handle empty display names and real names
- Added filtering to ensure empty strings are not used as display names
- Added debug logging to track the murayama/yandt89 name resolution issue
- The logic now properly tries: display_name -> real_name -> name -> user_id

### 2. Group DM Search Routing
**Problem**: Group DM channels with IDs starting with "C" (like C06TLSZQ8Q2) were not being routed to the DM search function
**Solution**:
- Enhanced the channel cache to store channel type information (is_im, is_mpim flags)
- Modified search routing to use cached channel type information instead of relying on ID prefixes
- Added fallback to ID prefix checking for channels not in cache
- This properly handles Group DMs that have regular channel-like IDs

## Code Changes

### src-tauri/src/state.rs
- Added `is_im` and `is_mpim` fields to `CachedChannel` struct
- Updated `cache_channel` method to accept these new parameters
- Added `get_channel_cache_full` method to retrieve complete channel information

### src-tauri/src/commands/search.rs
- Updated user map creation to better handle empty display names
- Added debug logging for user name resolution
- Modified DM search detection to use cached channel type information
- Updated all `cache_channel` calls to include channel type flags
- Fixed search routing to properly handle Group DMs with C-prefixed IDs

### src-tauri/src/commands/thread.rs
- Updated `cache_channel` call to include channel type flags

## Testing Notes

The implementation now properly:
1. Routes Group DM searches to the appropriate search function regardless of channel ID format
2. Resolves user display names with better fallback logic
3. Caches channel type information for improved search routing

## Debug Information

Added debug logging to help diagnose user name resolution issues:
- Logs when user "murayama" or "yandt89" is encountered
- Shows the mapping between user ID, name, and display name
