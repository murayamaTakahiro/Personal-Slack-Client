# Recovery Summary - Personal Slack Client

## Status: ✅ Successfully Restored

### What Happened
The app was showing a white screen after attempting Phase 2 performance optimizations. The issue occurred when trying to replace VirtualizedResultList with a simpler ResultList component.

### Actions Taken
1. **Identified the Problem**: The app was broken after modifying src/App.svelte and src/styles/zoom.css
2. **Performed Git Reset**: Used `git reset --hard b1ed9dc` to return to the last known working commit
3. **Verified Recovery**: 
   - Dev server is running without errors (only A11y warnings)
   - HTML is being served correctly at http://localhost:1420
   - VirtualizedResultList component is back in place

### Current State
- **Commit**: b1ed9dc "fix: 白い画面が表示される問題を修正"
- **Branch**: master
- **Working Tree**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **App Status**: Working with VirtualizedResultList for message display

### Lost Changes
The following Phase 2 optimizations were discarded:
- Attempt to replace VirtualizedResultList with ResultList
- CSS variable modifications in zoom.css

### How to Test
1. Open http://localhost:1420 in your browser
2. Or open the test file: `/mnt/c/Users/tmura/tools/personal-slack-client/personal-slack-client/test-app.html`
3. The app should display properly without a white screen

### Lessons Learned
- VirtualizedResultList is critical for the app's functionality
- Performance optimizations should be tested incrementally
- Always ensure a component exists before trying to import it

### Next Steps
If you want to re-attempt performance optimizations:
1. Create a new branch first: `git checkout -b performance-optimization`
2. Make smaller, incremental changes
3. Test after each change
4. Keep VirtualizedResultList or ensure any replacement component exists and is properly implemented
