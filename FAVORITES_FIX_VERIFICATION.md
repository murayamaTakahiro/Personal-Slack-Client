# User Favorites Persistence Fix - Verification Guide

## Problem Fixed
User favorites (especially for User ID search) were not persisting after application restart. The favorites would work during the session but would be lost when the app was restarted.

## Root Cause
The UserService singleton was instantiated before settings were loaded from persistent storage. The constructor was calling `get(settings)` which returned default/empty settings instead of the persisted ones containing saved favorites.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **UserService Changes** (`src/lib/services/userService.ts`)
- Added subscription to settings store to automatically sync favorites
- Removed immediate loading of favorites in constructor
- Added `reloadFavorites()` method for explicit reload
- Added `dispose()` method for cleanup

### 2. **Settings Store Changes** (`src/lib/stores/settings.ts`)
- Explicitly preserve `userFavorites` in the settings merge during initialization
- Ensures favorites are loaded from persistent storage

### 3. **UserSelector Component Changes** (`src/lib/components/UserSelector.svelte`)
- Added subscription to settings store for real-time updates
- Ensures UI reflects favorites even if loaded after component mount

## How to Test

### Test 1: Basic Favorites Persistence
1. Open the application in your browser (http://localhost:1420)
2. Click on the User dropdown in the filters section
3. Search for a user (type at least 2 characters)
4. Click the star (☆) icon next to a user to add them to favorites
5. Verify the user appears in the "Favorite Users" section
6. **Refresh the browser page (F5)**
7. Click on the User dropdown again
8. **Verify: The favorite user should still be there**

### Test 2: Multiple Favorites with Aliases
1. Add 2-3 users to favorites
2. For each favorite, click the pencil (✏️) icon to add an alias
3. Enter a memorable alias and save
4. **Close the browser tab completely**
5. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the app
6. Open the User dropdown
7. **Verify: All favorites with their aliases are preserved**

### Test 3: Storage Verification (Developer Tools)
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Check Local Storage for `localhost:1420`
4. Look for the `appSettings` key
5. **Verify: The value contains `userFavorites` array with your saved favorites**

### Test 4: Console Logs Verification
1. Open browser Developer Tools Console
2. Clear the console
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for these log messages:
   - `[Settings] Loading from store: appSettings`
   - `[Settings] Loaded settings:` (should show userFavorites)
   - `[UserService] Favorites updated from settings:` (should show count)
5. **Verify: Favorites are being loaded and synced properly**

## What Was Changed

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/lib/services/userService.ts` - Fixed initialization and added settings subscription
2. `/src/lib/stores/settings.ts` - Ensured userFavorites are preserved during initialization
3. `/src/lib/components/UserSelector.svelte` - Added settings subscription for UI updates

### Key Changes:
- UserService now subscribes to settings changes instead of reading once at construction
- Settings explicitly preserve userFavorites during merge
- UserSelector subscribes to settings for real-time updates
- Added proper cleanup for subscriptions

## Troubleshooting

If favorites are still not persisting:

1. **Check Browser Storage**:
   - Ensure localStorage is not blocked
   - Check if `appSettings` key exists in localStorage
   - Verify the stored JSON contains `userFavorites` array

2. **Check Console for Errors**:
   - Look for any errors related to storage access
   - Check for JSON parsing errors
   - Verify settings are being saved (look for `[Settings] Settings saved successfully`)

3. **Clear and Retry**:
   - Clear browser localStorage
   - Refresh the page
   - Add a favorite again
   - Check if it persists after refresh

## Expected Behavior

✅ Favorites should persist after:
- Page refresh (F5)
- Browser tab close and reopen
- Browser restart
- Application restart

✅ Favorites should include:
- User ID
- User display name
- User real name
- Custom aliases (if set)
- Avatar information

## Technical Details

The persistence flow now works as follows:
1. App starts → `initializeSettings()` loads from persistent storage
2. Settings loaded → Contains `userFavorites` array
3. Settings store updated → Triggers subscription in UserService
4. UserService updates internal favorites → Available to components
5. UserSelector subscribes to settings → Updates UI when favorites change
6. Any favorites change → Saved to persistent storage automatically
