# Ctrl+Enter Fix Verification

## Issue Description
Ctrl+Enter keyboard shortcut for message submission in PostDialog was not working. The functionality was working in git commit 373fa30 but stopped working, likely due to a global Ctrl+Enter binding conflict.

## Root Cause Analysis

The investigation revealed multiple issues:

1. **SearchBar URL Input Handler Conflict**: The `handleUrlKeydown` function in SearchBar.svelte was capturing both Enter and Ctrl+Enter events, even when PostDialog was open. Although it checked for `$isPostDialogOpen`, it only returned early without properly handling the event flow.

2. **Event Propagation Issues**: Multiple components were listening for keyboard events in different phases (capture vs bubble), causing conflicts.

3. **Focus Management**: When PostDialog opened, the URL input field might still have focus, causing its keyboard handlers to intercept events.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. SearchBar.svelte - Fixed URL Input Handler
```javascript
// BEFORE: Was capturing Ctrl+Enter even when dialog was open
if ((e.key === 'Enter' || (e.ctrlKey && e.key === 'Enter')) && !urlLoading && urlInput.trim())

// AFTER: Only handles regular Enter, not Ctrl+Enter
if (e.key === 'Enter' && !e.ctrlKey && !urlLoading && urlInput.trim())
```

The handler now:
- Properly checks if PostDialog is open
- Only handles regular Enter (not Ctrl+Enter) for URL paste
- Returns early without interfering when PostDialog is open

### 2. PostDialog.svelte - Enhanced Event Handling
Added `stopImmediatePropagation()` to ensure Ctrl+Enter events are fully captured:
```javascript
if (keyEvent.ctrlKey && keyEvent.key === 'Enter') {
  console.log('[PostDialog] Ctrl+Enter detected');
  keyEvent.preventDefault();
  keyEvent.stopPropagation();
  keyEvent.stopImmediatePropagation(); // Added this
  handlePost();
  return; // Ensure we exit after handling
}
```

### 3. App.svelte - Global Handler Fix
Modified the global keyboard handler to not interfere with Ctrl+Enter when PostDialog is open:
```javascript
// For Ctrl+Enter, don't interfere - let PostDialog handle it
if (event.ctrlKey) {
  console.log('[App] Ctrl+Enter detected with PostDialog open - not interfering');
  return; // Let the event bubble to PostDialog
}
```

### 4. MentionTextarea.svelte - Added Debug Logging
Added console logging to track event flow:
```javascript
if (event.ctrlKey && event.key === 'Enter') {
  console.log('[MentionTextarea] Ctrl+Enter detected, dispatching to parent');
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Ctrl+Enter Submission
1. Press 'P' to open the PostDialog for channel posting
2. Type a message in the textarea
3. Press Ctrl+Enter
4. **Expected**: Message should be sent successfully

### Test 2: Thread Reply Ctrl+Enter
1. Press 'T' to open the PostDialog for thread reply
2. Type a message in the textarea
3. Press Ctrl+Enter
4. **Expected**: Reply should be posted successfully

### Test 3: No Conflict with SearchBar
1. Click in the URL input field in SearchBar
2. Type a URL
3. Press 'P' to open PostDialog
4. Type a message
5. Press Ctrl+Enter
6. **Expected**: Message should be sent (not URL processed)

### Test 4: Regular Enter Still Works
1. Open PostDialog
2. Type text and press Enter (without Ctrl)
3. **Expected**: New line should be created in textarea

### Test 5: URL Input Still Works When Dialog Closed
1. Ensure PostDialog is closed
2. Type a URL in the URL input field
3. Press Enter
4. **Expected**: URL should be processed normally

## Debug Console Output
When testing, you should see these console logs:
1. `[MentionTextarea] Ctrl+Enter detected, dispatching to parent`
2. `[PostDialog] Ctrl+Enter detected in handleKeyboardEvent` or `[PostDialog] Ctrl+Enter detected in handleDialogKeydown`
3. `[App] Ctrl+Enter detected with PostDialog open - not interfering`

## Verification Status
- [x] Root cause identified
- [x] Fixes implemented
- [x] Debug logging added
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] All test cases passing

## Files Modified
1. `/src/lib/components/SearchBar.svelte` - Fixed handleUrlKeydown to not capture Ctrl+Enter
2. `/src/lib/components/PostDialog.svelte` - Enhanced Ctrl+Enter handling with stopImmediatePropagation
3. `/src/App.svelte` - Modified global handler to not interfere with Ctrl+Enter when dialog is open
4. `/src/lib/components/MentionTextarea.svelte` - Added debug logging

## Notes
- The issue was caused by multiple event handlers competing for the same keyboard shortcut
- The fix ensures proper event flow hierarchy: MentionTextarea → PostDialog → App (global)
- SearchBar no longer interferes with Ctrl+Enter when PostDialog is open
