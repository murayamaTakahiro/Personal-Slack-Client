# MPDM Group DM Name Resolution Fix Verification

## Problem Identified
The Group DM name `mpdm-takuya.taguchi--y.kurihashi--yandt89-1` was not properly resolving "yandt89" to "murayama" because:

1. The code was entering the `starts_with("mpdm-")` branch (lines 812-831)
2. That branch was treating the segments (like "yandt89") as user IDs
3. But "yandt89" is a USERNAME, not a user ID
4. User IDs look like "U04F9M6JX2M", not "yandt89"

## Fix Applied
Modified the `mpdm-` handling code (lines 812-862) to:

1. Split the name by "--" to get usernames (not user IDs)
2. For each username, iterate through all users to find matching `user.name`
3. Once found, look up the user's ID in user_map to get display name
4. This properly resolves "yandt89" â†’ find user with name="yandt89" â†’ get ID "U04F9M6JX2M" â†’ lookup in user_map â†’ get "murayama"

## Key Code Changes
```rust
// OLD CODE (lines 818-827) - Incorrectly treating as user IDs:
for uid in user_ids {
    let clean_uid = uid.trim_end_matches("-1");
    if let Some(user_name) = user_map.get(clean_uid) {  // Wrong! "yandt89" is not a user ID
        resolved_names.push(user_name.clone());
    }
}

// NEW CODE (lines 825-856) - Correctly treating as usernames:
for username in usernames {
    // Look through all users to find the one with this username
    for user in &users {
        if user.name.trim().eq_ignore_ascii_case(username.trim()) {
            // Found user, get display name from user_map using their ID
            if let Some(display_name) = user_map.get(&user.id) {
                found_display_name = Some(display_name.clone());
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Expected Result
When processing `mpdm-takuya.taguchi--y.kurihashi--yandt89-1`:
1. Removes "mpdm-" prefix â†’ `takuya.taguchi--y.kurihashi--yandt89-1`
2. Removes "-1" suffix â†’ `takuya.taguchi--y.kurihashi--yandt89`
3. Splits by "--" â†’ `["takuya.taguchi", "y.kurihashi", "yandt89"]`
4. For each username:
   - "takuya.taguchi" â†’ finds user, gets display name
   - "y.kurihashi" â†’ finds user, gets display name
   - "yandt89" â†’ finds user with ID U04F9M6JX2M â†’ gets "murayama" from user_map
5. Final result: "ðŸ‘¥ takuya.taguchi, y.kurihashi, murayama"

## Testing
The fix has been implemented in `/mnt/c/Users/tmura/tools/personal-slack-client/personal-slack-client/src-tauri/src/commands/search.rs` at lines 812-862.

To test:
1. Build: `cargo build`
2. Run the app: `npm run tauri dev`
3. Search in Group DM channel G07DC5WNQJ5
4. Verify that the channel name shows "murayama" instead of "yandt89"
