# DM User Display Fix Summary

## Problem
Some DM channels were showing user IDs (e.g., `@U01NH3ZB2TU`) instead of usernames in the channel list.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Bot users** - The `SlackUserInfo` model didn't include `is_bot` field, so bot users weren't being handled specially
2. **Deleted users** - The model also didn't include `deleted` field for deactivated users
3. **Missing users** - Some users might not be in the initial users.list response due to:
   - External/shared channel users
   - Users that require individual fetching
   - API permission limitations

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Extended User Model (src/slack/models.rs)
Added `is_bot` and `deleted` fields to `SlackUserInfo`:
```rust
pub struct SlackUserInfo {
    // ... existing fields ...
    pub is_bot: Option<bool>,
    pub deleted: Option<bool>,
}
```

### 2. Enhanced User Display Name Logic (src/commands/search.rs)
- **Bot users**: Display as `@[Bot] BotName` using `real_name` (often more descriptive for bots)
- **Deleted users**: Display as `@[Deleted] Username`
- **Regular users**: Standard priority (display_name > real_name > username)

### 3. Fallback User Fetching
If a user isn't found in the initial users.list response, the system now:
1. Detects when a DM shows only a user ID
2. Attempts to fetch that user individually via `users.info` API
3. Applies appropriate formatting based on user type

### 4. Debug Commands Added (src/commands/debug.rs)
- `debug_missing_users`: Analyzes which DM users are bots, deleted, or missing
- Helps identify problematic user IDs for further investigation

## Testing

Run the application and check the DM list:
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

1. Enable "Show DMs" toggle in the channel list
2. DMs should now show as:
   - `@John Smith` (regular users)
   - `@[Bot] Slackbot` (bot users)
   - `@[Deleted] OldUser` (deleted users)
   - Instead of `@U01NH3ZB2TU` (raw user IDs)

## Debug Tools

Use the debug script to analyze DM users:
```bash
./debug-dm-users.sh
```

This will show:
- Total users vs bot users vs deleted users
- Which specific user IDs are problematic
- Whether they can be fetched individually

## Future Improvements

1. **Caching**: Cache bot/deleted user info to avoid repeated API calls
2. **Batch fetching**: When multiple users are missing, fetch them in parallel
3. **Guest users**: Add support for guest/external users with special formatting
4. **Performance**: Consider pre-fetching all DM users on app startup
