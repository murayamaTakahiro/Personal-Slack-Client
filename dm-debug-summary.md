# DM Channel Integration Debug Summary

## Problem
DM channels were not appearing in the channel selector even after the DM integration was implemented.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issues Found:
1. **Settings Merge Issue**: The `experimentalFeatures` object was not being properly merged when loading saved settings, causing the `dmChannelsEnabled` flag to be overwritten with defaults.

2. **Missing Deep Merge**: The settings initialization was using spread operators which don't properly merge nested objects like `experimentalFeatures`.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Settings Initialization
**File**: `/src/lib/stores/settings.ts`

Added proper deep merging for experimental features:
```typescript
experimentalFeatures: {
  ...defaultSettings.experimentalFeatures,
  ...(loadedSettings.experimentalFeatures || {})
}
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to trace the flow:

**Frontend** (`/src/App.svelte`):
- Logs whether DM feature is enabled
- Shows number of DM channels received
- Lists first few DM channels for verification

**Backend** (`/src-tauri/src/commands/search.rs`):
- Logs when `include_dms` parameter is received
- Shows DM channel mapping (user ID to display name)
- Reports total channels returned including DM count

## How the DM Integration Works

1. **Feature Flag Check**: App checks `$settings.experimentalFeatures.dmChannelsEnabled`
2. **Channel Loading**: If enabled, `getUserChannels(true)` is called with `include_dms: true`
3. **Backend Processing**:
   - Fetches regular channels
   - If `include_dms` is true, fetches DM channels via Slack API
   - Maps user IDs to display names (format: `@username`)
   - Combines both channel lists
4. **Frontend Display**: Channels (including DMs) are shown in the channel selector

## Testing Steps

1. Enable experimental DM feature in settings
2. Reload the application (or switch workspaces to trigger channel reload)
3. Check browser console for debug logs:
   - Should see: `[DEBUG] Loading channels with DM feature enabled: true`
   - Should see: `[DEBUG] DM channels found: [number]`
4. Type "@" in the search/channel selector
5. DM channels should appear with "@username" format

## Required Permissions
The Slack token needs the `im:read` scope to access DM channels.

## Next Steps
- Phase 2: Add DM message search capability (requires `im:history` scope)
- Phase 3: Full DM channel interaction (send messages, reactions, etc.)
