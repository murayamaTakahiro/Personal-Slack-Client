# DM Search Phase 2 - Implementation Complete

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Enhanced DM Mode Toggle Button (SearchBar.svelte)
- **Visual Improvements**:
  - Added "DM Mode" text label when active
  - Better styling with primary color and shadow when active
  - Clear tooltips explaining the feature
  - Improved icon with clearer stroke width

### 2. Improved DM Search Notice (SearchBar.svelte)
- **Two States**:
  1. When DM mode is active but no DM selected: "DM Search Mode Active - Select a DM from the left panel"
  2. When DM is selected: "Searching in DM: [DM Name]"
- **Actions**:
  - "Change DM" button to select a different DM
  - "Exit DM Mode" button to leave DM search mode
- **Auto-clear**: When toggling off DM mode, selected DM is cleared

### 3. Enhanced DMChannelsList Component
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Animated border with pulse effect when in search mode
  - Clear prompts: "Select a DM below to search within it"
  - Selected DM shows with gradient background and left border
  - Transform and shadow effects on selected DM

- **Better Messaging**:
  - When not in search mode: "Tip: Click the DM button in the search bar above to enable DM search mode"
  - When in search mode with selection: "Enter keywords in the main search bar to search this DM"

### 4. Integration Flow
The complete flow now works as follows:

1. **Enable DM Mode**: Click the DM button in the search bar (it turns blue)
2. **Select a DM**: Click on a DM from the left panel (it highlights with blue background)
3. **Search**: Enter keywords in the main search bar - searches are automatically restricted to the selected DM
4. **Change DM**: Click "Change DM" or select a different DM from the list
5. **Exit**: Click "Exit DM Mode" or toggle the DM button off
