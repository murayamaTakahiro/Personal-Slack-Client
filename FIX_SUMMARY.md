# Fix Summary for Blank Screen Issue

## Problem
The application shows a white/blank screen when launched with Tauri.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Store Initialization Timing**: The `savedSearchesStore` initializes immediately on module load, which can cause issues if the Tauri environment isn't ready.

2. **Tauri Plugin Import**: The `persistentStore.ts` tries to import `@tauri-apps/plugin-store` which might fail in certain environments.

3. **Missing Error Boundaries**: Critical initialization code lacks proper error handling.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Deferred Store Initialization
- Modified `savedSearches.ts` to defer initialization using `setTimeout`
- This prevents blocking the app startup

### 2. Safe Tauri Import
- Modified `persistentStore.ts` to use lazy loading for Tauri store
- Added fallback to localStorage if Tauri store isn't available

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added console logging throughout initialization
- Added try-catch blocks in critical sections
- Modified `main.ts` to handle mounting errors gracefully

### 4. Debug Logging
- Added extensive console.log statements to track initialization flow
- Makes it easier to identify where failures occur

## Testing Steps

1. **Browser Test**:
   - Open `test-browser.html` in a browser
   - Click "Test App Loading" 
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Dev Server Test**:
   - Run `pnpm dev`
   - Navigate to http://localhost:1420
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for initialization logs

3. **Tauri Test**:
   - Run `pnpm tauri dev`
   - Check if the app window opens
   - Look for console output in the terminal

## Expected Console Output

When working correctly, you should see:
```
[Main] Starting application initialization
[Main] Mounting App to element: <div id="app">
[PersistentStore] Development mode detected, using localStorage
[SavedSearches] Deferred initialization starting...
[SavedSearches] Starting initialization...
[SavedSearches] Initialization complete
[App] Starting onMount initialization
[App] Initializing settings...
[App] Settings initialized
[App] onMount initialization completed successfully
```

## If Still Not Working

1. Check for JavaScript syntax errors in browser console
2. Verify all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
3. Clear browser cache and localStorage
4. Try running in incognito/private mode
5. Check if antivirus/firewall is blocking Tauri

## Additional Debug Options

If needed, you can:
1. Use the `AppDebug.svelte` component for minimal testing
2. Comment out store imports one by one to isolate the issue
3. Add more console.log statements in problem areas
