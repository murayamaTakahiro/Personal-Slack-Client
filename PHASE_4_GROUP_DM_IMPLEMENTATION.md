# Phase 4: Group DM (MPIM) Search Implementation

## Summary
Phase 4 adds support for Group Direct Messages (Multi-Party Instant Messages - MPIMs) to the personal Slack client's search functionality. This extends the existing DM search capability to include group conversations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (src-tauri/src/slack/client.rs)

#### Updated `get_dm_channels()`:
- Changed conversation types from `"im"` to `"im,mpim"` to fetch both DMs and Group DMs
- Added filtering logic to include channels where `is_im` OR `is_mpim` is true
- Enhanced logging to show separate counts for DMs and Group DMs

#### Updated `search_dm_messages()`:
- Added detection for Group DM channel IDs (starting with "G")
- Updated error messages to mention both DM and Group DM scopes
- Improved logging to distinguish between DM and Group DM searches

#### Updated helper functions:
- Modified `build_search_query()` to handle Group DM channel IDs (G...)
- Updated `resolve_channel_id()` to recognize D and G prefixes

### 2. Backend Changes (src-tauri/src/commands/search.rs)

#### Updated channel detection logic:
- Extended DM channel detection from `ch.starts_with("D")` to also include `ch.starts_with("G")`
- Added proper channel type identification in logs

#### Enhanced `get_user_channels()`:
- Added logic to distinguish between regular DMs and Group DMs
- Group DMs are displayed with a "游논" prefix followed by the conversation name
- Regular DMs continue to use "@" prefix with the user's name
- Added separate counting for DMs and Group DMs in logs

### 3. Model Updates (src-tauri/src/slack/models.rs)

#### Added to SlackConversation:
- Added `name_normalized` field to support Group DM names

## API Requirements

The implementation requires the following Slack API scopes:
- `im:read` - Read direct messages
- `mpim:read` - Read group direct messages
- `im:history` - Access direct message history
- `mpim:history` - Access group direct message history

## User Experience

### Channel Display:
- Regular DMs: Displayed as "@username"
- Group DMs: Displayed as "游논 GroupName" or "游논 Group-DM-{id}" if no name available

### Search Behavior:
- Both DM and Group DM channels can be searched using the same interface
- Search uses `conversations.history` API for both channel types
- Filtering by query text works identically for both channel types

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Ensure your Slack token has the required scopes
2. Run the application and navigate to Settings
3. Enable "Include DMs" in the channel selector
4. Look for channels with:
   - "@" prefix (regular DMs)
   - "游논" prefix (Group DMs)
5. Select a Group DM and perform searches

## Technical Details

### Channel ID Formats:
- Regular DM channels: Start with "D" (e.g., D096JP29HQH)
- Group DM channels: Start with "G" (e.g., G1234ABCD)
- Regular channels: Start with "C"

### API Endpoints Used:
- `conversations.list` with types="im,mpim" - Fetch all DM and Group DM channels
- `conversations.history` - Search messages within DMs and Group DMs

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing DM functionality remains unchanged
- No breaking changes to the API or UI
- Group DM support is additive, not replacing any existing features

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future phases:
- Show participant names/avatars for Group DMs
- Add ability to create new Group DMs
- Implement typing indicators for Group DMs
- Add Group DM-specific features like naming conversations
