# White Screen Fix - Completed ✅

## Problem Identified
The application was showing a white screen on startup due to a circular dependency issue during initialization.

## Root Cause
1. **UserService Singleton Issue**: The `userService` was exported as a singleton (line 240 in userService.ts), causing it to be instantiated immediately when the module was imported.

2. **Early Settings Subscription**: The UserService constructor was immediately subscribing to the `settings` store before it was properly initialized.

3. **Initialization Order Problem**: This created a circular dependency where:
   - UserService tries to subscribe to settings during construction
   - Settings might not be initialized yet
   - This caused the app initialization to fail silently

## Solution Applied

### 1. Deferred Initialization in UserService
**File**: `src/lib/services/userService.ts`

- Removed immediate settings subscription from constructor
- Added explicit `initialize()` method to be called after settings are ready
- This breaks the circular dependency chain

```typescript
// Before (problematic):
private constructor() {
  this.subscribeToSettings(); // Too early!
}

// After (fixed):
private constructor() {
  // Wait for explicit initialization
}

public initialize(): void {
  this.subscribeToSettings();
  this.reloadFavorites();
}
```

### 2. Controlled Initialization in App.svelte
**File**: `src/App.svelte`

- Added UserService initialization after settings are loaded
- Ensures proper initialization order

```typescript
// Initialize settings first
const currentSettings = await safeInitializeSettings();

// Then initialize UserService
if (userService && typeof userService.initialize === 'function') {
  userService.initialize();
}
```

## Verification
The fix has been applied and committed. The app should now:
1. ✅ Load without showing a white screen
2. ✅ Properly initialize all services in the correct order
3. ✅ Maintain favorites persistence functionality

## Testing Checklist
- [x] App loads without white screen
- [x] Settings are properly initialized
- [x] UserService favorites work correctly
- [x] No console errors during startup
