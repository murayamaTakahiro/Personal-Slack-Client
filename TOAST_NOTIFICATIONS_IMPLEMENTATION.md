# Toast Notifications Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive user-friendly toast notifications for all file download operations in the Slack client application.

## Changes Made

  - "Download started" - Shows when download begins with file name
  - "Download complete" - Shows file name and save location on success
  - "Download failed" - Shows detailed error message on failure
- Added enhanced notifications for batch downloads:
  - Shows total number of files being downloaded
  - Displays completion status (X of Y files)
  - Shows save location in success message
  - Lists individual file names for small batches (â‰¤5 files)

#### FileAttachments.svelte (`/src/lib/components/files/FileAttachments.svelte`)
- Added batch download notifications:
  - Progress tracking for multiple files
  - Success messages with file count and location
  - Detailed error messages on failure

#### GenericFilePreview.svelte (`/src/lib/components/files/GenericFilePreview.svelte`)
- Added download notifications for generic files:
  - Download start notification
  - Success/failure messages with file names

### 2. Toast Notification Features

#### Types of Notifications
- **Info** (Blue): Download started, progress updates

- **Error** (Red): Download failed with error details
- **Warning** (Yellow): Important alerts

#### Notification Details Include
- File name(s) being downloaded

- Clear error messages on failure
- Auto-dismiss timings:
  - Info: 5 seconds (default)
  - Success: 7 seconds for single files, 10 seconds for batches
  - Errors: 10 seconds (longer for user to read)
  - Progress updates: Persistent (0 duration) until completed

### 3. Existing Infrastructure Used
- Leveraged existing toast store (`/src/lib/stores/toast.ts`)
- Used existing Toast component (`/src/lib/components/Toast.svelte`)
- Imported helper functions: `showSuccess`, `showError`, `showInfo`

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see notification as soon as download starts
2. **Clear Status**: Users know exactly what's happening with their downloads
3. **Location Awareness**: Success messages show where files were saved
4. **Batch Progress**: Users can track progress of multiple file downloads
5. **Error Transparency**: Clear error messages help users understand issues
6. **Non-Intrusive**: Toasts appear in top-right corner without blocking content
7. **Auto-Dismiss**: Notifications disappear automatically after appropriate duration
8. **Manual Dismiss**: Users can close notifications early if desired

## Testing

Created `test-toast.html` for manual testing of toast notifications with:
- Test buttons for different scenarios
